## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Parse Content">
    The system analyzes the input text to identify all Unicode emoji characters, including standard emojis, symbols, and pictographs.
    
    <Info>
    The algorithm recognizes standard Unicode emoji ranges and removes all character types that fall within these ranges.
    </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Remove Emojis">
    All identified emoji characters are removed while preserving text, numbers, punctuation, and standard symbols (like $, %, @).
    
    <Tip>
    Important text elements like URLs, email addresses, hashtags, and mentions are preserved intact.
    </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Clean Formatting">
    Extra spaces that may result from emoji removal are handled, though some spacing irregularities may remain.
    
    <Note>
    The system preserves original text structure and line breaks while removing only emoji characters.
    </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Return Cleaned Text">
    The cleaned content is returned with original and edited versions for comparison.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Content Review
<Tip>
Always review the cleaned content before using it, as emoji removal may create spacing issues or affect readability.
</Tip>

- **Check spacing** - Multiple consecutive emojis may leave extra spaces
- **Review flow** - Ensure the text still reads naturally without emojis
- **Verify meaning** - Confirm that essential meaning isn't lost with emoji removal

### Workflow Integration

**Pre-processing steps:**
1. Save original content as backup
2. Apply emoji removal
3. Review and manually adjust if needed
4. Use cleaned content for target platform

**Quality checks:**
- Ensure URLs and links remain intact
- Verify hashtags and mentions are preserved
- Check for any unintended character removal
