## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Identify Hashtags">
    The system scans the content to locate all hashtag patterns, including both the `#` symbol and the associated text.
    
    <Info>
    The algorithm recognizes hashtags by the `#` character followed by alphanumeric text without spaces.
    </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Remove Hash Symbols">
    All `#` characters are removed from the content, regardless of whether they form valid hashtags or appear standalone.
    
    <Tip>
    The system removes the `#` character specifically, not the text that follows it, preserving the underlying keywords.
    </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Preserve Other Content">
    All other content including mentions (@), URLs, punctuation, and special characters are preserved exactly as they appear.
    
    <Note>
    Email addresses, phone numbers, and other content that might contain `#` symbols are processed the same way.
    </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Return Cleaned Text">
    The cleaned content is returned with original and edited versions for comparison.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Use Cases

### Email Marketing
Transform social media content for email campaigns where hashtags don't provide value.

Output: "Join our webinar on digitalmarketing strategies!  "
```

### Press Releases

### Newsletter Content
Clean content for professional newsletters and corporate communications.

### Platform Migration
Adapt content from hashtag-heavy platforms (Twitter, Instagram) to platforms that don't use hashtags effectively.

### Print Materials

## Best Practices

### Content Review
<Tip>
Always review the cleaned content before using it, as hashtag removal may create spacing issues or affect readability.
</Tip>

- **Check spacing** - Multiple consecutive hashtags may leave extra spaces
- **Review flow** - Ensure the text reads naturally without hashtags
- **Preserve meaning** - Verify that important keywords aren't lost in the cleaning process

### Strategic Hashtag Handling

**Before removal, consider:**
1. Which hashtags contain important keywords worth preserving?
2. Are there hashtags that should be converted to regular text?
3. Does the content need restructuring after hashtag removal?

**Post-processing options:**
- Manual editing to improve spacing
- Converting important hashtag text to regular keywords
- Restructuring sentences that relied heavily on hashtags

### Platform-Specific Considerations

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Email Marketing">
- Hashtags provide no SEO or discovery value in email

- Use bullet points for keyword emphasis
</Tab>

<Tab title="Press Releases">
- Professional media doesn't use hashtag formatting

- Maintain formal business tone throughout
</Tab>

<Tab title="Print Materials">

- Use traditional formatting for emphasis
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Workflow Integration

**Recommended process:**
1. **Extract hashtags** - Save hashtag list before removal for reference
2. **Apply removal** - Clean content using the API
3. **Review and edit** - Manually adjust spacing and flow
4. **Incorporate keywords** - Add important hashtag keywords back as natural text
5. **Final review** - Ensure content meets platform requirements

### Content Optimization

**After hashtag removal:**
- **Add structure** - Use headings, bullet points, or numbered lists
- **Enhance readability** - Break up long paragraphs that relied on hashtag breaks
- **Include CTAs** - Add clear calls-to-action where hashtag CTAs were removed
- **Preserve SEO** - Integrate important keywords naturally into sentences
