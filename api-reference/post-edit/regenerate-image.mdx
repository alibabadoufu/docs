## Overview

The regenerate image endpoint creates new images based on the latest image generation prompt found in a conversation thread. This allows you to create variations of images without having to provide the prompt again.

<Info>
This endpoint requires frontend role authentication and a valid thread ID containing image generation history.
</Info>

## Endpoint

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Locate Image Prompt">
    The system searches through the conversation thread to find the most recent image generation prompt and associated parameters.
    
    <Tip>
    The endpoint looks for prompts used in previous image generations within the same thread, ensuring consistency with your original vision.
    </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Extract Generation Parameters">
    Original image generation settings (dimensions, style, seed values) are retrieved to maintain consistency while creating variation.
    
    <Info>
    The system automatically handles image dimensions, aspect ratios, and other technical parameters from the original request.
    </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Generate New Image">
    A new image is created using the same prompt but with a different seed value, producing a variation of the original concept.
    
    <Check>
    Images are automatically optimized for social media platforms and stored securely in cloud storage.
    </Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Store and Return URLs">
    Both original and newly generated image URLs are returned for comparison and selection.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Error Handling

<ResponseExample>
```json Error Response
{
    "id": "edit_error_456",
    "operation": "regeneration_image",
    "status": "failed",
    "error": "No image prompt found in conversation thread",
    "processing_time": 0.12,

    "created_at": 1704067200
}
```

### Common Errors

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Missing Thread ID">
**Error:** "Thread ID is required for image regeneration"

**Solution:** Ensure you include the `thread_id` parameter in your request. This is mandatory for the endpoint to locate the original image prompt.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="No Image Prompt Found">
**Error:** "No image prompt found in conversation thread"

**Solution:** The thread must contain at least one previous image generation request. Use a thread that has generated images before, or create images first using the chatbot endpoint.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Invalid Thread">
**Error:** "Thread not found or no content available"

**Solution:** Verify the thread_id exists and has accessible conversation history. The thread must be associated with your account.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Generation Service Error">
**Error:** "Error generating image: [technical details]"

**Solution:** This indicates a temporary issue with the image generation service. Wait a moment and retry the request. If the issue persists, contact support.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Processing Time

<Info>
Image generation typically takes 5-15 seconds depending on:
- Image complexity and dimensions
- Current system load
- Generation queue length
</Info>

**Typical processing times:**
- Simple images: 5-8 seconds
- Complex scenes: 8-12 seconds
- High-resolution images: 10-15 seconds

<Tip>
For user experience optimization, consider implementing a loading state in your application during image generation.
</Tip>

## Use Cases

### Content Variation
Generate multiple versions of the same concept for A/B testing or different platforms.

### Creative Exploration
Explore different interpretations of your original image concept without rewriting prompts.

### Backup Options
Create alternative images when you need multiple options for the same post.

### Consistency Maintenance
Generate images that maintain visual consistency with your established brand aesthetic.

## Best Practices

### Thread Management
- **Keep conversations focused** - Use dedicated threads for image generation sessions
- **Document image prompts** - Save successful prompts for future reference
- **Organize by project** - Use separate threads for different campaigns or content types

### Workflow Integration
- **Generate original first** - Always create an initial image before using regeneration
- **Review conversation history** - Ensure the thread contains the image prompt you want to reuse
- **Plan for processing time** - Account for 5-15 second generation time in your workflow

### Quality Control
- **Compare variations** - Review both original and regenerated images before selection
- **Test across platforms** - Verify images work well across different social media platforms
- **Maintain brand consistency** - Ensure regenerated images align with your brand guidelines
