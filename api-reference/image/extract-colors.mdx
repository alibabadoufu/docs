## Overview

This endpoint analyzes an image from a provided URL and extracts the dominant colors. It returns up to 3 main colors that each represent more than 10% of the image, sorted by percentage coverage.

## Endpoint

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL

    -d '{
        "image_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
    }'
```

```python Python

## Technical Details

### Color Analysis Process

1. **Image Download**: The image is downloaded from the provided URL with a 10-second timeout
2. **Color Extraction**: Uses the ColorThief algorithm to identify dominant colors
3. **Percentage Calculation**: Analyzes pixel distribution to calculate color percentages
4. **Filtering**: Only colors representing â‰¥10% of the image are included
5. **Sorting**: Results are sorted by percentage coverage (highest first)
6. **Limiting**: Maximum of 3 colors are returned

### Supported Image Formats

- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- GIF (.gif)
- WebP (.webp)
- BMP (.bmp)
- TIFF (.tiff)

### Performance Considerations

- Images are automatically resized to 100x100 pixels for color analysis to improve performance
- Processing time typically ranges from 1-5 seconds depending on image size and complexity
- Original image quality and color depth affect accuracy of color extraction

<Tip>
For best results, use high-quality images with distinct colors. Images with gradients or many similar shades may result in fewer qualifying colors.
