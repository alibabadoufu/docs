## Integration with Content Generation

<Steps>
<Step title="Analyze the Website">
Use this endpoint to extract comprehensive brand information from a client's website.

<Check>
Store the analysis_id for future reference and to avoid re-analyzing the same website.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Extract Brand Guidelines">
Use the brand_voice, color_palette, and brand_identity information to inform content generation.

```python
# Example: Using analysis for content generation
brand_voice = analysis['brand_voice']
content_prompt = f"""
Create social media content that matches this brand voice:
- Tone: {brand_voice['tone']}
- Personality: {', '.join(brand_voice['personality'])}
- Target Audience: {brand_voice['target_audience']}
- Key Messages: {brand_voice['key_messages']}
"""
```
</Step>

<Step title="Generate Branded Content">
Pass the extracted brand information to content generation endpoints for consistent, on-brand social media posts.

<Note>
The brand analysis can be reused for multiple content generation requests, saving time and ensuring consistency.
</Note>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Website Access Denied">
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "error": "Access denied: Website blocks automated access (403 Forbidden)"
}
```

**Solution**: Some websites block scraping. Try accessing the website manually to verify it's publicly accessible.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Invalid URL">
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "error": "Invalid URL format. Please include protocol (http:// or https://)"
}
```

**Solution**: Ensure the URL includes the protocol and is properly formatted.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Timeout">
```json
{
  "status": "failed",
  "error": "Website analysis timeout after 60 seconds"
}
```

**Solution**: The website may be slow to respond. Try again or contact support if the issue persists.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Insufficient Content">
```json
{
  "status": "partial",
  "error": "Limited content available: Website appears to be primarily JavaScript-based with minimal accessible content"
}
```

**Solution**: Single-page applications and heavily JavaScript-based sites may have limited extractable content.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Performance Optimization**: Website analysis can take 10-60 seconds depending on site complexity. Consider caching results and running analysis asynchronously.
</Tip>

<Steps>
<Step title="Validate URLs First">
Ensure URLs are properly formatted and accessible before sending to the API.

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def validate_url(url):
    if not re.match(r'^https?://', url):
        return False
    try:
        result = urlparse(url)
        return all([result.scheme, result.netloc])
    except:
        return False
```
</Step>

<Step title="Cache Analysis Results">
Store analysis results to avoid repeated API calls for the same website.

<Check>
Analysis results remain relevant for weeks or months unless the website undergoes major changes.
</Check>
</Step>

<Step title="Handle Partial Results Gracefully">
Always check the status and handle partial results appropriately in your application.

```python
if analysis['status'] == 'partial':
    # Use available data but inform user of limitations
    available_data = {k: v for k, v in analysis.items() if v is not None}
    # Log what failed for debugging
    logger.warning(f"Partial analysis: {analysis.get('error', 'Unknown issue')}")
```
</Step>

<Step title="Use Additional Fields Selectively">
Only request additional fields you actually need to minimize processing time and costs.

<Note>
Each additional field increases processing time by 1-3 seconds.
</Note>
</Step>
</Steps>
